# Smart-Capture-Face-dection

## Overview
SmartCapture is a sophisticated surveillance system that combines cutting-edge face detection algorithms with intelligent motion recognition to provide real-time monitoring and recording capabilities. This project aims to revolutionize traditional surveillance methods by offering advanced features such as accurate face detection, motion-based image capture, and seamless integration with existing security systems.

## Features
- Real-time face detection: SmartCapture uses computer vision techniques to accurately detect and recognize faces within a video stream.
- Motion-based image capture: The system intelligently captures images when significant motion is detected, ensuring key moments are not missed.
- Video recording: SmartCapture records video streams in real-time, allowing continuous monitoring and playback of surveillance footage.
- Easy integration: The project is implemented in Python using OpenCV, making it easy to integrate with existing security systems and applications.
- Scalability: SmartCapture is designed to scale with the needs of your organization, whether you're monitoring a single location or multiple sites.

## Installation
1. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mithun/smartcapture.git`

## Usage
1. Run the `smartcapture.py` script to start the surveillance system.
2. Adjust the settings (e.g., face detection parameters, motion detection threshold) as needed.
3. Monitor the video stream in real-time and review captured images and recordings as necessary.
